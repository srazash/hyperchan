# What is hyperchan?

***hyperchan*** is a copy (not a 1:1 clone) of 4chan, the (in)famous imageboard site.

The aim is to create a chan-like imageboard using a modern, resilient, scalable and ***secure*** tech stack.

The planned features of hyperchan include:

- a home page that displays recent threads and posts, and popular boards
- a simple thread and post architecture, for image and text posts
- admin/mod controlled boards, anonymous users can *request* a board but cannot *create* one
- GREENTEXT
- a simple, public API for viewing site stats
- a secure API for site administration and moderation
- ***more to come!***
